# Two-Layer Neural Network on MNIST ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š
## This project uses a **two-layer fully connected neural network** for **handwritten digit classification** with the **MNIST dataset**. The model is developed from scratch in Python without the use of deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
